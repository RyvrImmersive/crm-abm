# Clay-HubSpot Integration Frontend

This is the frontend for the Clay-HubSpot Integration application. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing the integration between Clay and HubSpot, including company data synchronization, scheduling, and configuration.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

#### Deploying to Render

This application is configured to be deployed to Render using the `render.yaml` file in the root directory of the project. To deploy to Render:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Create a new Render account or log in to your existing account
3. Create a new Blueprint instance and connect it to your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and create the necessary services
5. Set up the required environment variables in the Render dashboard

#### Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in the Render dashboard:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The URL of your backend API (e.g., `https://clay-hubspot-api.onrender.com/api`)
